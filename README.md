# Textual Analysis of "Alice in Wonderland" (Python)
This project involves the textual analysis of the classic novel "Alice in Wonderland" using Python. A PyTorch neural network algorithm was designed and implemented for text analysis. The project includes evaluations of LSTM model accuracy through tests with varying epoch numbers and an examination of text generation results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed. Additionally, you can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch numpy nltk matplotlib
python -m nltk.downloader all
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jon-Best-SWE/Textual-Analysis-of-Alice-in-Wonderland.git
cd Textual-Analysis-of-Alice-in-Wonderland
```

2. Analyze the Data
The Python scripts provided in this repository (`Jon_Best_Alice_in_Wonderland_LSTM_Torch_Code.py`) contain code for analyzing the "Alice in Wonderland" textual dataset. It is not meant to be run directly from the command line but should be executed within a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Open in a Python Environment
You can open and run the provided Python scripts in a Python IDE (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook) or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

4. Run the Code
Inside your Python environment, you can execute the code within these scripts to perform the analysis.

5. View the Results
The results and visualizations will be displayed within your Python environment.

Please note that these scripts are designed for data analysis and should not be run as standalone command-line applications.
